			<h2>Fay Feeney, CEO, Risk For Good</h2>
			<p>
				Risk for Good helps corporate boards and directors monitor, leverage and govern the fast moving landscape of social media and the internet. The impact of this movement is changing business strategy. We apply our expertise in risk management to help corporate board directors survive and thrive in this digital landscape. While some businesses have not yet entered the social media space their customers, investors and employees have gone on line. Businesses everywhere are trying to figure out how to use social media as a competitive advantage. We help corporate boards and directors identify the strategic threats and opportunities to their brand. With these insights directors can anticipate, plan for and adapt to this transparent business environment.
