<h3 id="program">The Program</h3>
<p>"Corporate Governance" has certainly captured headlines and - for good reason - the attention of boards, management, shareholders, regulators, auditors and capital markets. Today, understanding, designing, evaluating, enhancing, measuring and monitoring corporate governance is a priority objective for many, if not most organizations.</p>
<p>Strategies, objectives and practices underlying corporate governance continue to evolve and challenges exist.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>How best to define corporate governance? The concept of corporate governance is inherently broad, covers a wide range of distinct phenomenon and is subject to varying interpretations.</li>
    <li>What is the "Gold Standard" for corporate governance and business ethics?</li>
    <li>How much further than legal minimum requirements for corporate governance should corporations go to ensure sustainable success?</li>
    <li>What has been the impact on global corporations and foreign markets?</li>
    <li>How best to align the unique culture and operating environment of your organization with relevant "leading practices?"</li>
    <li>What are "best practices," what have been the "lessons learned" and "what's next" in corporate governance?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Inaugural USC Corporate Governance Summit will address these issues, as well as the full range of corporate governance considerations -- facilitated by a selected group of experienced speakers and panelists from industry, government and academe.</p>
<p>USC, teaming with Resources Global Professionals (Resources), is in a unique position to host this Summit by bringing together Corporate Governance practitioners from Resources, experts from the USC School of Law, the Marshall School of Business, and the Leventhal School of Accounting and a wide range of speakers and panelists with hands-on experience.</p>
<p>The program is designed to give directors and executives the information they need to meet the challenges of governance today with accountability, integrity and informed judgment (not to mention peace of mind).</p>
