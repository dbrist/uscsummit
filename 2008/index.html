<h3 id="program">The Program</h3>
<p>As global leaders in business education, the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California has established an annual Corporate Governance Summit featuring thought leaders from industry and academia. USC's inaugural session took place Spring 2006 and featured outstanding speakers such as Don Nicolaisen, Dennis Beresford, and Sharon Allen.</p>
<p>The topics and issues associated with Corporate Governance are quite dynamic and evolving daily and are prominent subjects in our news. These issues will be addressed, discussed, and debated at the USC Corporate Governance Summit 2008.</p>
<p>USC's program, teaming with <a href="http://www.resourcesglobal.com/globalgateway/gg_selectcountry.html?retcountry=1">Resources Global Professionals</a> (Resources), will present Corporate Governance practitioners, experts from the USC Marshall School of Business and the Leventhal School of Accounting, and a wide range of speakers and panelists with hands-on experience.</p>
<p>The program is designed to give directors and executives the information they need to meet the challenges of governance today.</p>
