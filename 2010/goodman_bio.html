			<h2>Brian D. Goodman, Senior Practice Leader, Legal & Regulatory, Resources Global Professionals</h2>
<p>Brian D. Goodman is the Senior Practice Leader for the Legal & Regulatory practice. He is charged with strategic planning, business development, marketing, and client relationship management for the Legal & Regulatory practice in the Western Region, comprised of 18 offices in the U.S. and Mexico. Mr. Goodman joined Resources in 2004 to design the Legal & Regulatory practice with one single goal in mind: to better serve in-house legal departments. The result is Resources' novel approach to "in-sourcing" top-notch legal professionals, most hailing from AmLaw 100 firms and possessing in-house counsel experience. As a trusted partner, Mr. Goodman has helped chief legal officers to operate their departments more efficiently, reduce legal expenses, and implement strategic initiatives.

 </P>
 
<p>Today, Resources' model for globally "in-sourcing" legal professionals is widely admired and viewed as a best practice, and Mr. Goodman, who is frequently quoted in the legal and local media, has become a recognized thought leader in the rapidly evolving legal services field. Clients turn to Resources for needs ranging from work overflow to special projects, critical imperatives or crises, global or local in scope and requiring one professional or a large team deployed to various locations. Mr. Goodman works closely with other Resources' practice groups in offices around the world to provide clients with integrated services spanning legal, regulatory, compliance, risk management, auditing, and forensic accounting, and addressing matters such as mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, IPOs, investigations, and litigation.

 </p>
 
<p>Before joining Resources, Mr. Goodman was a corporate attorney focused on general corporate representation, venture capital financings, mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, and technology transactions. Previously, he was senior corporate counsel and secretary at ticketing technology company, Paciolan, Inc. and corporate counsel at search company, AltaVista. Prior to his in-house roles, Mr. Goodman worked at the Kansas City law firm of Shook, Hardy & Bacon, L.L.P. and served as a judicial intern for the Honorable Arthur B. Federman, Chief United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Western District of Missouri. Mr. Goodman earned his J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law, and a B.S. in business economics and public policy from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.  Mr. Goodman holds numerous leadership roles in his community, including serving on the Board of Directors at the nonprofit organization Human Options. In 2010, he was honored as one of OC METRO's 40 Under 40.
