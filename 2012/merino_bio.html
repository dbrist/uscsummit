			<h2>Ed Merino, Founder and CEO, Office of the Chairman </h2>
			<p>
				Ed Merino is chief executive officer and founder of Office of the Chairman. Ed is a boardroom executive coach whose clients are Board Chairmen, Board Members, CEOs, and their direct reports. Key to his coaching is helping executives move from "success to significance." His clients include Fortune 500 companies in Finance, Media and Entertainment, Banking, and Technology, as well as private and family businesses. For over a decade, Ed has been an adjunct coach for one of the world's leading career transition and organizational consulting firms. In this capacity, he has counseled its most senior executive clients. He has developed a process that allows executives to authenticate themselves. Some call it "the essential biography" - Ed calls it the "Bio B," a word picture that describes who you are, not what you have been or what you have done.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ed has over 25 years of boardroom experience as Board Chair, CEO and Board Member (public and private). He also served for six years as Director of Corporate Governance at a Big Four accounting firm's Orange County regional headquarters. He is Chairman Emeritus of the Forum for Corporate Directors, Orange County, and currently serves on the board of the National Association of Corporate Directors, Southern California chapter. He has created a "Director Education Roadmap" showing executives how to develop a governance education pedigree participating in programs at Harvard Business School, Stanford Law School, and the Anderson School of Management at UCLA. Ed has a Director Certificate from the Anderson School of Management's Executive Education Program. He studied mechanical and electrical engineering at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ed has been quoted in the Wall Street Journal, Orange County Register, Orange County Business Journal, Directors and Boards, Directorship, Corporate Boardmember magazine, CIO magazine, and other publications. In addition, he participated in the "Blue Ribbon Commission on Board Evaluation," publication of the National Association of Corporate Directors.
