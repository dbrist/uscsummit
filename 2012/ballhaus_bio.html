			<p>
				Dr. William F. Ballhaus, Jr., is the former president and chief executive officer of The Aerospace Corporation, an independent, nonprofit organization dedicated to the objective application of science and technology toward the solution of critical issues in the nation's space program. Aerospace has over 4,000 employees and annual sales of  $870M.  He retired from the company on December 31, 2007.  During the time Dr. Ballhaus led the Aerospace Corporation, there were no failures in over 50 launches of Air Force and National Reconnaissance Office satellite systems for which Aerospace had accountability for independent verification of launch readiness. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Ballhaus joined Aerospace as president in September 2000 after an 11-year career with Lockheed Martin Corporation. He was named CEO of Aerospace on May 1, 2001. At Lockheed Martin Dr. Ballhaus served as corporate officer and vice president, Engineering and Technology. In this position he was responsible for advancing the company's scientific and engineering capabilities, and for overseeing engineering and technology functions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to his tenure with Lockheed Martin, Dr. Ballhaus served as president of two Martin Marietta businesses, Aero and Naval Systems (Baltimore, 1993-1994), and Civil Space and Communications (Denver, 1990-1993). He also was vice president and program director of Titan IV Centaur operations at Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems (Denver, 1990).

				Before joining Martin Marietta, Dr. Ballhaus served as director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ames Research Center at Moffett Field and Edwards Air Force Base, California (1984-1989). He also served as acting associate administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. (1988-1989). Dr. Ballhaus held several other positions at NASA Ames, including director of Astronautics (1980-1984) and chief of the Applied Computational Aerodynamics Branch (1979). As a research scientist at Ames (1971-1978), Dr. Ballhaus published more than 40 papers on computational aerodynamics.

				Dr. Ballhaus has participated in a number of national level independent reviews of troubled space and missile programs.  For example, he served on President Clinton's Broad Area Review of the six launch system failures that occurred in 1998-1999.  He also served on the Defense Science Board study on the Acquisition of National Security Space Programs and on the Missile Defense Agency Independent Review of missile defense system test failures in the mid 2000s.
