<p> 
Chris Cernich is Director of M&A and Proxy Fight research for Institutional

Mr. Cernich is also the chief author of two studies sponsored by the IRRC
Institute. "The Effectiveness of Hybrid Boards" (2009) examined the impact of
shareholder activism on financial performance. "Compensation Peer Groups at
Companies with High Pay" (2010) explored systemic bias in compensation
benchmarking processes at S&P 500 companies. Mr. Cernich holds an MBA in
Finance and Strategy (2000) and a PhD in American Literature (1993), both
