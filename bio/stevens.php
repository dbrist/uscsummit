<h2>Ken Stevens</h2>
<h3>Partner, Advent International</h3>

        <p> Ken is an Operating Partner with Advent International, a global private equity firm with $20 billion of assets under management.  In addition, he is the Chairman of  the Board of both Charlotte Russe, a 
privately-held five hundred store young women’s apparel concept, and Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ), a six hundred-store beauty retailer.
</p>
    <p> Throughout his career, Ken has held leadership positions with companies that provide products and services to consumers.  He has also provided consulting services to consumer-focused companies. </p>
    <p> Ken spent the 1970s going to school (University of Redlands, BA in Philosophy and University of Southern California, MBA), becoming familiar with soft goods retailing at Bullock’s (a now-defunct division of the now-defunct Federated Department Stores) and getting a classical and practical education in Marketing and Product Management at General Mills. </p>
    <p> The 1980s found Ken slaving away at McKinsey in Los Angeles, where he was elected Partner and co-led the West Coast consumer practice.  His clients included food wholesalers, a toy manufacturer, a fast food retailer and a hospitality and gaming company.  Ken led consulting teams in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States. </p>
    <p> Ken returned to the real (i.e., non-consulting) world in the 1990s.  He led Strategic Planning at PepsiCo and was also Treasurer of the corporation.  Ken then went to Taco Bell (a PepsiCo subsidiary at the time) to lead the marketing team.  He was named President of Taco Bell shortly thereafter.  In the middle of the decade Ken made an unusual career move.  He became Chairman and CEO of the Bank One (now part of JP Morgan Chase) Retail Group.  In this role Ken was responsible for branch banking, mortgage banking, consumer lending, ATMs and call centers.  During this time he also became a member of the board of directors of La Quinta Inns (NASDAQ), California Pizza Kitchen and Carts of Colorado (both PepsiCo acquisitions). </p>
    <p> The 2000s marked a return to “hard core” retailing.  After a brief stint assisting a young entrepreneur with a healthcare marketing agency, Ken joined Limited Brands (now L Brands) Bath & Body Works division as COO and President.  He eventually became CEO of Express and was briefly CFO of the parent corporation, prior to his first retirement.  After a short retirement Ken joined Tween Brands (NYSE; formerly Limited Too, now Justice) as President and Director.  Also during this decade he joined the boards of Spartan Stores (NASDAQ),Virgin Mobile (NYSE) and Cost Plus World Market (NASDAQ), where he served as non-executive Chairman.  In Ken’s board tenure Virgin Mobile was sold to Sprint and Cost Plus World Market was sold to Bed Bath and Beyond. </p>
    <p> Ken retired again in 2008.  In 2009 he failed at retirement yet again. Ken joined philosophy (a Carlyle portfolio company that manufactured and marketed skin care and beauty products) as CEO. He was asked to establish and execute a growth strategy after several years of flat-to-negative performance.  Ken rebuilt the leadership team, re-focused the organization and put the company back on a growth trajectory.  After eighteen months Ken and Carlyle sold the business to Coty.  </p>
    <p> After a brief transition period with Coty Ken left the company. Ken has remained active in several businesses during his current “retirement”.  He joined the boards of Ulta and Charlotte Russe, and became an Advent International Operating Partner.  He has assisted with the evaluations of several acquisition targets and will continue to participate on boards of Advent portfolio companies as needed. </p>
    <p> Ken is the father of three “millenials”: James, a criminal defense attorney in California; Anne, a clinical psychologist in North Carolina; and, Alice, a graphic designer in New York.  He spends his free time on a road bike, attempting to stay upright and avoiding distracted drivers. Ken resides in Paradise Valley, Arizona.</p>
