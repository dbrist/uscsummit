<h1>Andy Enfield</h2>
<h3>Head Men's Basketball Coach, USC</h3>

<p>
Andy Enfield, 44, a proven winner as a player, assistant coach and head coach,
was named the USC men's basketball head coach on April 1, 2013 and
immediately brought a tangible buzz to the program.
</p>
<p>
Enfield captivated the nation as the head coach at Florida Gulf Coast
University as he guided the first No. 15 seed into the NCAA Sweet Sixteen
with impressive wins over No. 2 seed Georgetown and No. 7 seed San Diego
State and introduced the world to "Dunk City," the nickname for FGCU's high-
flying and high-speed offense which often ended with thunderous dunks.
Enfield was 41-28 in his two seasons (2012-13) at FGCU, with the 41 victories
equaling the program's combined total in the four years before he arrived. His
squads played an up-tempo offense that featured spectacular dunks and alley-
oops as well as a defense that thrived on takeaways. The Eagles scored 70-plus
points 25 times in 2013 and ranked 16th nationally in steals (8.9 per game).
Prior to going to FGCU, Enfield spent the previous five years (2007-11) as an
assistant coach at Florida State, helping the Seminoles to three consecutive
NCAA Tournaments (2009-11), including the Sweet 16 in 2011. Those were
the program's first NCAA trips since 1998. FSU posted four 20-win seasons
during his time on the staff (including in his final three seasons) and won 31
Atlantic Coast Conference games, the second-most behind Duke during that
span. The Seminoles advanced to the program's first-ever ACC championship
game in 2009. In 2010 and 2011, FSU became the first program since
Georgetown (1991-92) to lead the nation in defensive field goal percentage
two straight seasons.
</p>
<p>
Enfield began his coaching career in the NBA, serving as the shooting coach
for the Milwaukee Bucks for two seasons (1995-96). He then was an assistant
coach with the Boston Celtics for two seasons (1999-2000).
Enfield played four seasons (1988-91) at Johns Hopkins, scoring a program-
record 2,025 career points. He set the NCAA all-divisions career free throw
percentage record (92.5, hitting 431-of-466 shots). He was a Division III All-
American third teamer in 1991 and was inducted into the school's Athletic Hall
of Fame in 2001. He was a GTE Academic All-American first team selection
as a senior and second teamer as a junior. He was the first basketball player at
Johns Hopkins to earn an NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship and was named the
NABC Scholar-Athlete of the Year in 1991. He earned his economics degree
from Johns Hopkins in 1991. He has a master's in business administration from
Maryland. He prepped at Shippensburg (Penn.) High, where he was the class
valedictorian.
</p>
<p>
Enfield was born on June 8, 1969. He and his wife, Amanda, a former model
based in New York City, have two daughters, Aila and Lily, and a son,
Marcum.
